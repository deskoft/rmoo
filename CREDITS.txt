                                   RMOO 2.0

   Originally by [1]Ron Tapia <[2]tapia@nmia.com>
   Maintained by [3]Matthew Campbell <[4]mattcampbell@pobox.com>

Introduction

   RMOO is a MOO client for Emacs. In addition to the basic features
   present in any MOO client, RMOO includes more advanced features,
   mainly the ability to edit MOO notes, mail, and code in separate Emacs
   buffers and to easily send these buffers back to the MOO. RMOO also
   includes support for the [5]Emacspeak audio desktop, so that people
   who are blind and use Emacspeak can more easily use MOOs and other
   similar servers.

   You can always find the latest version of RMOO, along with pre-built
   Red Hat packages, at the [6]RMOO home page.

Release History

   Version 2.0 (WIP 2021)
          This version is still in progress.
   
   Version 1.1 (released October 18, 2000)
          This is a maintenance release. In this release, I removed the
          activity alert that Emacspeak users used to get while they were
          typing in an RMOO buffer, because it caused problems with Emacs
          20.5 and later. I also updated everything to reflect my new
          email address and Web site address. Finally, I quit using Latte
          and now write the HTML code myself.

   Version 1.0 (released January 17, 2000)
          This is a major release, and a lot has changed. I reworked the
          installation procedure to make it more like the standard
          procedure for Emacs packages and open-source software in
          general. I also improved support for Emacspeak and fixed other
          miscellaneous problems. In particular, I added special sounds
          that RMOO uses when running in conjunction with Emacspeak. I
          got them from a collection of [7]cow sounds that I found on the
          Web. I hope they will make your MOOing experience more fun.

   May 26, 1999
          In local editing, I added two new commands: C-c C-c now uploads
          the current buffer to the MOO and destroys the window, and C-c
          C-] destroys the window without uploading the buffer.

   May 23, 1999
          There is a new variable, rmoo-send-always-goto-end, which, if
          set to t, will make RMOO always go to the end of the buffer
          after sending a line, no matter where in the buffer the user
          was.

   March 21, 1999
          In this release, I have one specific goal: to make the RMOO
          extension for Emacspeak consistently notify the user of
          activity in a MOO buffer which is not his current buffer, and
          to make it consistently read that activity to the user when he
          switches to the MOO buffer. I believe I have achieved this
          goal.

   March 1, 1999

          + Fixed a typo in the installation section of the README.
          + Improved Emacspeak support with the help of [8]T. V. Raman.
          + Fixed C-c C-q command to provide reasonable feedback after
            disconnecting from the MOO.
          + Added this "Release History" section to the README file.
          + Converted this README file to [9]Latte, the Language for
            Transforming Text. Latte's primary use now is to generate
            HTML, and that is why I am using it. [10]Lynx is now used to
            generate the plain-text version of this document. I am also
            using [11]HTML Tidy to keep the generated markup clean.
          + Put the files in this package under RCS control, with the
            exception of the README and README.html files which are
            generated from the Latte source.

   February 20, 1999

          + New unofficial maintainer.
          + Added support for the Emacspeak audio desktop and fixed a bug
            in the process.
          + Moved default RMOO directory from ~/emacs/rmoo to ~/rmoo for
            easier installation.
          + Updated installation and W3 sections in the README.
          + Added "Introduction" and "Getting Started" sections.
          + Finally, this package is now in a tar.gz file instead of an
            uncompressed tar file.

   October 9, 1994
          Original version by Ron Tapia.

Requirements

   To use RMOO, you should have [12]GNU Emacs version 20 or later. I have
   not tested RMOO with XEmacs recently, though it may work. To take
   advantage of some features of the MOO Client Protocol (MCP), you will
   need [13]Emacs/W3 as well.

Installation

   To install RMOO from the source package, follow these steps:
     * Unpack the rmoo-1.1.tar.gz file.
     * Change to the new RMOO source directory (rmoo-1.1) and type the
       following commands as any user:
       ./configure
       make
     * Now, as root, type this while in the RMOO source directory: make
       install
     * Add the following line to your .emacs file or your
       /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el file:
       (require 'rmoo-autoload)

   You can also get a Red Hat package that is ready to install and use
   from the [14]RMOO home page.

  Upgrading from pre-1.0 versions of RMOO

   For users of RMOO versions before 1.0, you need to do a little
   preparation before installing the new version. When you installed an
   older version of RMOO, you had to add a block of code from a file
   called fragment-of-.emacs to your .emacs file. You must now remove
   this code, because it has moved into the main RMOO code. This block
   started with the following:
;;
;; Change this if you want to keep the rmoo source somewhere else.
;;

   and ended with the following:
(rmoo-load-libs)

   Once you have removed this block, you can continue with the normal
   RMOO installation procedure. At this point, you will not have the
   shortcut key (C-c m) that you used to use to start RMOO. TO get this
   back, refer to the Tips and Tricks section.

Getting Started

   Once you have installed RMOO using the instructions provided above,
   you can connect to a MOO any time by pressing M-x rmoo. When you are
   prompted for a MOO world, you can either enter one, optionally using
   Emacs's completion facility to help you, or you can press Enter
   without entering anything. If you do the latter, you will be prompted
   for the site and port, in addition to login name and password.

  World List Basics

   To add a new MOO world, type M-x rmoo-worlds-add-new-moo, and follow
   the prompts. Then save the world list by typing M-x rmoo-worlds-save.

Local Editing

   One of the great benefits of RMOO is the ability to edit MOO mail,
   code, or other text in a standard Emacs buffer, with all of the
   editing commands available. This is a great improvement over the
   primitive line editor provided by most MOOs. To turn on local editing
   on a standard LambdaCore-based MOO, type:

   @edit-options +local

   A new Emacs buffer will now be opened when you want to edit something
   on the MOO. RMOO provides instructions for sending the text to the MOO
   or closing the window without sending.

Tips and Tricks

   If you have trouble with RMOO leaving the point at the end of the line
   you just sent, you may find it helpful to add the following to your
   .emacs file:

   (setq rmoo-send-always-goto-end t)

   This will cause RMOO to always go to the end of the buffer after
   sending a line. You can also configure RMOO so that it will not send
   your input to the server unless you are on the last line of the
   buffer. This is helpful for Emacspeak users who review the MOO buffer
   with the cursor movement keys, and then start typing without going to
   the end of the buffer. To turn on this feature, add this to your
   .emacs file:

   (setq rmoo-send-require-last-line t)

   You may find it helpful to have a shortcut key that you can use to
   start RMOO. To add this feature, add the following to your .emacs
   file:

   (global-set-key "\C-cm" 'rmoo)

   You can now start RMOO with C-c m.

   Enjoy,
   Matt Campbell

;; Revision 1.8  2000/01/15 20:36:05  mattcamp
;; Added support for special MOO sounds, including a quick hack to notify the user via an auditory icon if new text arrives from the MOO while he's typing in that MOO buffer.
;;
;; Revision 1.7  1999/10/30 01:09:47  mattcamp
;; Moved requires for emacspeak modules into a condition-case, as in w3-speak, so that this module will compile when emacspeak isn't loaded.
;;
;; Revision 1.6  1999/07/18 00:10:58  mattcamp
;; Added an advice form for the rmoo function to provide an appropriate
;; auditory icon and sync Emacspeak with the synthesizer.  Also removed
;; the line to load the buff-menu library and replaced the many advice
;; forms on buffer-related functions with a single advice form for
;; emacspeak-speak-mode-line, to make sure that emacspeak-rmoo-catchup is
;; called wherever it makes sense to call it.
;;
;; Revision 1.5  1999/03/21 14:33:05  mattcamp
;; Replaced the algorithm for determining whether a user should be notified
;; of activity in a MOO buffer with something that is more reliable and
;; makes more sense.
;;
;; Revision 1.4  1999/03/20 19:43:32  mattcamp
;; Took a little advice from the Emacspeak code (pun completely intended)
;; and fixed the advice forms to act only when the functions are called
;; interactively, then added advice for the functions that open buffers
;; selected from the buffer menu.  Now the system should consistently
;; read missed activity in a MOO buffer when the user switches to that
;; buffer.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  1999/03/20 17:31:59  mattcamp
;; Simplified the code that sets the emacspeak-rmoo-unheard-output-start
;; and emacspeak-rmoo-unheard-output-end variables.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  1999/03/07 04:18:29  mattcamp

;; Revision 1.9  1999/07/17 19:25:40  mattcamp
;; Now all of the RMOO setup code runs when the rmoo function runs (if

;;
;; Revision 1.8  1999/06/13 02:19:23  mattcamp
;; Integrated RMOO setup (the loading of extra libraries and the worlds file), which was formerly placed in the user's .emacs file, into this file, so users don't have to add the large code block to their .emacs files anymore.
;;
;; Revision 1.7  1999/05/28 01:18:15  mattcamp

;; Forgot to make rmoo-upload-and-destroy interactive, so I fixed that.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  1999/05/26 23:38:08  mattcamp
;; Added function rmoo-upload-and-destroy to upload a buffer, kill the buffer, and delete the window.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  1999/05/24 01:23:41  mattcamp
;; Added rmoo-send-always-goto-end option to make RMOO always go to the end

;;
;; Revision 1.1  1999/03/02 00:23:09  mattcamp
;; Initial revision
;;
;; Pre-RCS modifications by Matthew Campbell <mattcampbell@pobox.com>:
;; Fixed a bug in rmoo-handle-text that prevented rmoo-handle-text-hooks
;; from being run correctly.  Also modified rmoo-quit to provide reasonable
;; feedback after the user confirms his choice to disconnect.
